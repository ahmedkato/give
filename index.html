<p>An opinionated donation app for Non-profits using <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> 
written in <a href="https://meteor.com">Meteor</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>

<p>Give is used by non-profits to take donations using Stripe. Which includes Credit/Debit Cards, ACH. </p>

<h2>
<a id="problems-addressed" class="anchor" href="#problems-addressed" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problems addressed</h2>

<p>Non-profits want to allow anyone to give with or without an account. 
However, we also want to give them credit for doing so. This is a problem. 
How do we track givers while letting them give without an account? The answer is;
 we do all the hard work. First, we will end up with a lot of customers in Stripe
  since each time a person gives without logging in we can't know if they've given before.
Second, we want to do our best to make sure we don't have duplicates in our CMS,
 so we search backwards and forwards to see if we can find them there.</p>

<p>If we think this is a new person, we insert them into the CMS as a new person 
and send off an email to the support admin letting them know we just inserted a 
new person. Chances are we'll end up with newly inserted people who really shouldn't
 be new people at all. Users misspell things, they change their address and phone
  numbers and sometimes give under shortened version of their names. (and these 
  are just a few reasons we'll still get duplicates)</p>

<a id="setup" class="anchor" href="#setup" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setup</h2>

<p>Once you have this repo cloned you'll want to setup a settings.json file. This 
is where your Donor Tools and Stripe```` settings go (you can use the <a href="/#settings">example</a> below 
to get started) as well as your organization's domain name and other settings. </p>

<p>Before running this app edit the server/fixtures.js file and change the email 
address to your address and a set a temporary password there too.</p>

<p>Run the app with <code>meteor --settings settings.json</code></p>

<p>Once you are logged in you should see the "Start Here!" label on the "Organization 
Info." button. Click that and complete the form.</p>

<p>Each time you complete a section, more of the app is unlocked.</p>

<p>After the Organization Info. form is completed you'll see the Settings and Giving 
Options buttons. </p>

<p>You'll want to complete the Settings form first, then the Giving Options. The 
Giving Options section pulls in all the Donor Tools funds so that you can use 
them to create all the giving options you want donors to be able to choose. </p>

<p>In order to use the <strong>image uploading</strong> you'll need to make sure that the user running
the meteor process on your server can make changes to the .uploads folder. You'll
also need to create the <code>thumbnailSmall</code> and <code>thumbnailBig</code> folders inside the
<code>.uploads</code> directory. 
<code>chown -R meteoruser /opt/give/.uploads /opt/give/.uploads/thumbnailSmall /opt/give/.uploads/thumbnailBig</code></p>

<a id="webhooks" class="anchor" href="#webhooks" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Webhooks</h2>

<p>In order to get updates about charges, transfers and many other resources via Stripe 
you'll need to point a webhook in the 
<a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard">Stripe dashboard</a> to 
https://yourSiteURL/webhooks/stripe</p>

<h2>
<a id="more" class="anchor" href="#more" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>More</h2>

<p>These are the integrations built into Give already</p>

<p>Payment Processing, including recurring gifts - Stripe</p>

<p>Mandrill (MailChimp's transactional email service) - Transactional emails (used for receipting and failure notices)</p>

<p>DonorTools, a CRM for non-profits.</p>

<p>You will need an account with each of these providers in order to use Give.

only a fee per transaction (2.9% + .30 per transaction for credit/debit cards). 
ACH fees are $0.80 per charge and there is no fee for transfers to your own bank account after charging the customer. </p>
