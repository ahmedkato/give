Which includes Credit/Debit Cards, ACH. \r\n\r\n## Problems addressed\r\n\r\nNon-profits want to allow anyone to give with or without an account. \r\nHowever, we also want to give them credit for doing so. This is a problem. \r\nHow do we track givers while letting them give without an account? The answer is;\r\n we do all the hard work. First, we will end up with a lot of customers in Stripe\r\n  since each time a person gives without logging in we can't know if they've given before.\r\nSecond, we want to do our best to make sure we don't have duplicates in our CMS,\r\n so we search backwards and forwards to see if we can find them there.\r\n\r\nIf we think this is a new person, we insert them into the CMS as a new person \r\nand send off an email to the support admin letting them know we just inserted a \r\nnew person. Chances are we'll end up with newly inserted people who really shouldn't\r\n be new people at all. Users misspell things, they change their address and phone\r\n  numbers and sometimes give under shortened version of their names. (and these \r\n  are just a few reasons we'll still get duplicates)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nOnce you have this repo cloned you'll want to setup a settings.json file. This \r\nis where your Donor Tools and Stripe```` settings go (you can use the [example](/#settings) below \r\nto get started) as well as your organization's domain name and other settings. \r\n\r\nBefore running this app edit the server/fixtures.js file and change the email \r\naddress to your address and a set a temporary password there too.\r\n\r\nRun the app with ```meteor --settings settings.json```\r\n\r\nOnce you are logged in you should see the \"Start Here!\" label on the \"Organization \r\nInfo.\" button. Click that and complete the form.\r\n\r\nEach time you complete a section, more of the app is unlocked.\r\n\r\nAfter the Organization Info. form is completed you'll see the Settings and Giving \r\nOptions buttons. \r\n\r\nYou'll want to complete the Settings form first, then the Giving Options. The \r\nGiving Options section pulls in all the Donor Tools funds so that you can use \r\nthem to create all the giving options you want donors to be able to choose. \r\n\r\nIn order to use the **image uploading** you'll need to make sure that the user running\r\nthe meteor process on your server can make changes to the .uploads folder. You'll\r\nalso need to create the ```thumbnailSmall``` and ```thumbnailBig``` folders inside the\r\n```.uploads``` directory. \r\n```chown -R meteoruser /opt/give/.uploads /opt/give/.uploads/thumbnailSmall /opt/give/.uploads/thumbnailBig```\r\n\r\n## Webhooks \r\n\r\nIn order to get updates about charges, transfers and many other resources via Stripe \r\nyou'll need to point a webhook in the \r\n<a href=\"https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard\">Stripe dashboard</a> to \r\nhttps://yourSiteURL/webhooks/stripe\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nMove these to the configuration and out of the settings.json file\r\n\r\n  newStuffVersion\r\n\r\nDocument Services\r\n  Papertrail\r\n  TrackJS\r\n  Kadira\r\n  Heap\r\n\r\nDocument Setup process\r\n\r\nDocument Limitations of Integration with Stripe (No micro-deposit or Plaid at the moment)\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nhttps://give.trashmountain.com/landing\r\n\r\nThis is a live giving page, which is being used by Trash Mountain Project. \r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n\r\nHere is an example settings.json file. Each of the fields are required.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"dev\": \"****TEST****\", // If you are using this settings.json file on the dev side include this text, if on the live side, leave it blank.\r\n  \"donor_tools_user\": \"\",\r\n  \"donor_tools_password\": \"\",\r\n  \"stripe\": {\r\n    \"secret\": \"Secret Stripe key\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"public\": {\r\n    \"dev\": \"****TEST****\", // If you are using this settings.json file on the dev side include this text, if on the live side, leave it blank.\r\n    \"newStuffVersion\": \"e.g. '0.9' This is used to show the user new updates and then increment those updates.\", // This is being deprecated\r\n    \"org_domain\": \"Your org domain, for example 'trashmountain.com'\",\r\n    \"stripe_publishable: \"publishable Stripe Key\",\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## More\r\n\r\nThese are the integrations built into Give already\r\n\r\nPayment Processing, including recurring gifts - Stripe\r\n\r\nMandrill (MailChimp's transactional email service) - Transactional emails (used for receipting and failure notices)\r\n\r\nDonorTools, a CRM for non-profits.\r\n\r\nYou will need an account with each of these providers in order to use Give. \r\nThe accounts are free up to a point. Stripe doesn't charge you a monthly fee, \r\nonly a fee per transaction (2.9% + .30 per transaction for credit/debit cards). \r\nACH fees are $0.80 per charge and there is no fee for transfers to your own bank account after charging the customer. \r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n",
